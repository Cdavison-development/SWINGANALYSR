To begin, follow the steps shown at: https://github.com/wmcnally/golfdb to acquire the necessary
pre-requisites for the golf sequencing/ image segmentation system.

input gathered amateur golf footage into Amateur-vids at directory golfdb/VideoData


All golfDB models other than the one used have been removed, if wanted, generate using “train.py”
The full video repository has also been removed, only the necessary videos remain, if access to the
full repository is needed, download at :
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uBwRxFxW04EqG87VCoX3l6vXeV5T5JYJ/view
and place in “data” file

If any problems arise within the image segmentation system, clone the repository shown above and
insert both “ProfessionalSegmentation” and “AmateurSegmentation” into the golfDB directory.
Within the GolfDB directory,

To segment the professional golf footage, run “ProfessionalSegmentation.py”

To segment the amateur footage, run “amateur segmentation.py”

The segmented images are stored in their respective files within “ImageData.py”

Go to the Pose_estimation folder stored in the root directory

Run both “AmateurKeypointToJson.py” and “ProfessionalKeypointToJson.py”, this will store the
keypoint data in respective Json Files.

Run “JsonComparison.py” to find the Top 3 closest golfers in terms of Euclidean distance.

I am aware that this is very rushed documentation, therefore any questions are welcome 

Run “JsonAvg.py” to find the average keypoint data of these 3 golfers.

Go to the root directory and run “feedback.py” to return feedback data.
