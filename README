quick note: Im seeing alot of unique viewers on this repo and I have no idea where this attention is coming from :satisfied: , if some of you could let me know where the attention is coming from it would be much appreciated.
(where are the facebook users coming from ?! :sweat_smile:)

!!documentation is a work in progress and the system will likely not work in the current state!!

research paper found at: https://mega.nz/file/ElJj1QYA#RGF2tecRgPFRti779KoFv5_-Q4DBY-DA8-fQDNEZju8

This documentation is rather rushed so please message if any errors arise

Library requirements:
• openAI
• math
• json
• pytorch
• numpy
• OpenCv
• Mediapipe
• OS
• math

To begin, follow the steps shown at: https://github.com/wmcnally/golfdb to acquire the necessary
pre-requisites for the golf sequencing/ image segmentation system.

input gathered amateur golf footage into Amateur-vids at directory golfdb/VideoData, The video should be shot at a down-the-line camera angle, the club used should be a driver.

download the full professional golf swing repository and extract the full file to golfdb/data:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uBwRxFxW04EqG87VCoX3l6vXeV5T5JYJ/view

run filedeleter.py to cleanse the professional dataset so only videos in which the subject uses a down-the-line camera angle and the driver club left,
move remaining video files to golfdb/VideoData/Fast_Drive_DTL.

download the Golfdb implementation of the swingnet baseline model and place file into golfdb/models (do not attempt to unzip): 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MBIDwHSM8OKRbxS8YfyRLnUBAdt0nupW/view 


If any problems arise within the image segmentation system, clone the repository shown above and
insert both “ProfessionalSegmentation” and “AmateurSegmentation” into the golfDB directory.
Within the GolfDB directory,

To segment the professional golf footage, run “ProfessionalSegmentation.py”

To segment the amateur footage, run “amateur segmentation.py”

The segmented images are stored in their respective files within “ImageData.py”

Go to the Pose_estimation folder stored in the root directory

Run both “AmateurKeypointToJson.py” and “ProfessionalKeypointToJson.py”, this will store the
keypoint data in respective Json Files.

Run “JsonComparison.py” to find the Top 3 closest golfers in terms of Euclidean distance.

I am aware that this is very rushed documentation, therefore any questions are welcome 

Run “JsonAvg.py” to find the average keypoint data of these 3 golfers.

Go to the root directory and run “feedback.py” to return feedback data.
